This repository contains the slides and notes for the lectures in Econometrics A at the University of Copenhagen. 

Lectures are given by [Bertel Schjerning](https://www.econ.ku.dk/ansatte/vip/?pure=da/persons/180168).

Lectures are organized as follows:

1. [Introduction](1_lectures/01_intro)
2. [Linear Regression](1_lectures/02_slr)
3. [Multiple Linear Regression](1_lectures/03_mlr)
4. [Inference in Regression](1_lectures/04_inference)
5. [Asymptotics](1_lectures/05_asymptotics)
6. [Simulation](1_lectures/06_simulation)
7. [Dummy Variables](1_lectures/07_dummyvars)
8. [Pisa Example](1_lectures/08_pisa)
9. [Heteroskedasticity](1_lectures/09_heteroskedasticity)
10. [Prediction](1_lectures/10_prediction)
11. [Measurement Error](1_lectures/11_measurementerror)
12. [Time Series](1_lectures/12_timeseries)
13. [Instrumental Variables](1_lectures/13_iv)
14. [Panel Data](1_lectures/14_paneldata)

Each lecture is contained in a separate folder. The folder contains the slides for the lecture in PDF format and jupyter notebook slides for numerical/empirical illustrations. The repository also contains Python code replication of the examples in the slides. Data used in the examples are collected in the [data](data) subfolder. So make sure to keep the entire repo updated to get the data as well.

Most folders are empty at the moment, but they will be filled as we progress through the course. You will see updates in the git log.
